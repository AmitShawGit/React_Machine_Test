Certainly! Here are a few practice questions that you can use to prepare for a React machine test:

1. Create a React component that displays a list of items fetched from an API endpoint. Each item should be rendered as a separate component.

2. Implement a form component that validates user input before submitting the form. Display error messages if the input is invalid.

3. Build a React component that fetches data from an API and renders a chart using a third-party library (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js).

4. Create a reusable modal component that can be opened and closed using a button or other trigger.

5. Develop a React component that integrates with a third-party authentication service (e.g., Firebase) to handle user registration and login.

6. Build a pagination component that allows users to navigate through a large list of items by displaying a certain number of items per page.

7. Implement a search component that filters a list of items based on user input. The search should update in real-time as the user types.

8. Create a component that fetches geolocation data from the browser and displays the user's current location on a map using a mapping library (e.g., Google Maps or Mapbox).

9. Develop a file upload component that allows users to select and upload files to a server. Display the progress of the file upload.

10. Build a responsive navbar component that collapses into a mobile-friendly menu when viewed on smaller screens.

These questions cover a range of topics and concepts commonly used in React development, including API integration, form validation, data visualization, third-party library integration, authentication, pagination, search functionality, geolocation, file upload, and responsive design.

Feel free to adapt these questions or modify them according to your specific needs and the skills you want to test.
